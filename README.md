# -Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis

This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis related to Play Store apps data using Python, with a focus on unearthing pivotal factors influencing app engagement and success. Leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, the objective is to provide actionable insights to refine app performance in the Android market.

The project revolves around two datasets—the Play Store Dataset and the User Reviews Dataset—housing diverse app information. The Play Store dataset, encompassing 10,841 rows and 13 columns, encountered a considerable challenge with 483 instances of duplicated rows. This redundancy not only jeopardizes the integrity of the dataset but also distorts analytical results, potentially leading to skewed insights and inaccurate conclusions.

Moreover, the prevalence of missing values across key columns compounds the complexity of the dataset. Notably, the 'Rating' column, crucial for assessing app quality, exhibits 13.60% null values, introducing ambiguity and hindering accurate evaluations. The 'Type,' 'Content Rating,' 'Current Ver,' and 'Android Ver' columns also grapple with varying degrees of missing values, necessitating meticulous attention to ensure a comprehensive and reliable dataset.

The User Reviews dataset, comprising 64,295 rows and 5 columns, confronts its own set of challenges, notably with 33,616 instances of duplicated rows. Duplicates introduce redundancy and potentially amplify the impact of certain reviews, jeopardizing the representativeness of the dataset.

The data cleaning process becomes even more imperative when confronted with the staggering prevalence of missing values in the 'Translated_Review,' 'Sentiment,' 'Sentiment_Polarity,' and 'Sentiment_Subjectivity' columns. With null values ranging around 41.78%, a significant portion of the dataset is incomplete, demanding strategic handling to ensure a coherent and informative analysis. This includes identifying non-numeric reviews, converting data types, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates. Normalization, scaling, and outlier treatment contribute to refining the datasets, paving the way for meaningful insights.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase unveils critical insights, transcending mere statistical analysis. Visual representations, such as histograms, pie charts, bar charts, and reg plots, provide a nuanced understanding of user sentiments, app ratings, genre preferences, and the impact of updates over time. This deeper exploration forms the bedrock for strategic decision-making in app development and optimization.
